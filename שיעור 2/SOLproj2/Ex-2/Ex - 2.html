<p>You are expected to write a console application with the following capabilities:</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Print a message that asks the user to type his first name.</li>
	<li>Receive the data from the user.</li>
	<li>Display a message with 3 options as folows:<i><br>&nbsp Choose your option:<br>&nbsp 1 - Buy a stock.<br>&nbsp 2 - Buy stocks on sales.</i>.</li>
	<li>
		According to the user's input do the following:<br>
		&nbsp <b>If the user chose to buy stocks:</b><br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>1.</b> Print a message asking the user to insert the price of the desired stock (whole numbers).<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>2.</b> Receive the data from the user.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>3.</b> Print a message asking the user to insert the number of the desired stocks.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>4.</b> Receive the data from the user.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>5.</b> If the number of stocks is <b>even</b>, than calculate the total amount to pay and print to the screen.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>6.</b> If the number of stocks is <b>odd</b>, than print a message informing that this application cannot calculate odd numbers of stocks.<br><br>
		&nbsp <b>If the user chose to buy stocks on sale:</b><br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>1.</b> Print a message asking the usr to insert the regular price of the desired stock (price for one stock).<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>2.</b> Receive the data from the user.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>3.</b> Print a message asking the user to insert the amount of the desired stock he would like to purchase on sale.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>4.</b> Receive the data from the user.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>5.</b> If the number of stocks is <b>more than 10</b, than each stock will cost 50% off the regular stock price (50% discount).<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>6.</b> If the number of stocks is <b>exactly 10</b>, than each stock will cost 20% off the regular price (20% discount).<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>7.</b> If the number of stocks is <b>less than 10</b>, than there will be no discount..<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>8.</b> Print the data as follows:
		<i>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stock regular price is: |stock regular price|.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stocks amount: |stocks amount|.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stock regular price is: |stock regular price|.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Discount percent is: |dicsount percent|.<b>(This number will be printed as a whole precent: 0.2 will be 20%)</b> <br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stock price after discount is: |stock price after discount|.<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Total amount to pay: |total cost of stocks purchased on sale|.<br><br>
		</i>
		&nbsp <b>If the user chose a number that is not listed in the options above:</b><br>
		&nbsp&nbsp <b>1.</b> Print the following message to the user:<br>
		&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp <i>This option is not a valid option!</i>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<P>Do not forget to write some documentations ( use // or /**/ )</P>
<P>Indentation is crucial (use the right tabing)</P>

<p>Whenever the user is prompt to insert a value, you can take from granted that 
	the value inserted is valid. For example if the user is suppose to insert an 
	integer and instead he inserts a string it is not up to you to handle the error 
	(or at least not for this exercise).

<p>
	Please stick to the same indentation conventions we use in our examples and 
	which the Visual Studio .NET help create. Use a clear and understandable names 
	for your variables, for example the best name for the user&#39;s name will be (surprisingly) 
    userName.</p>
